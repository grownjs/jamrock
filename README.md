# TODO

- [ ] {expr} remain intact within syle: and class: tags
- [ ] ctx.subscribe and such is missing from servers
  - [x] nodejs
  - [ ] deno
  - [ ] bun

- [ ] runtime (nodejs, deno, bun)
  - [ ] server-side
    - [ ] websockets
          ^ adds `ctx.socket.emit/fail`
          - [x] nodejs
          - [ ] deno
          - [ ] bun
    - [-] web-server (lacks of ws!)
      - [-] nodejs
      - [-] deno
      - [-] bun
        ^^ make sure it's compliant, reuse APIs from Remix/Svelte, likely Request/Response objects
  - [ ] client-side
    - [ ] client components
      - [ ] built-in runtime
    - [ ] svelte components
      - [ ] hydrate?
- [ ] watcher/compiler
      ^ nodejs only, use lib for runtime
      ... actually the compiler runs on deno/bun,
          so we could build sources on demand... or through a fs-watch?
            ^ both deno/bun have a file-watcher mode built-in but only watches for imports...
              so, unless we write the generated module it'll not reload... even worse,
              the custom loader would not work either... so, we cannot leverage on this

              ...instead, do a simple watcher in nodejs, run it, and fire bun/deno if desired apart... (HMR?)
              btw, the cli could spawn the nodejs/deno/bun servers if needed...

## Server handler

The entry point to your application is the web-server, you need to save this **server.js** file in the root of your project, or within a folder, if so ensure you set the appropriate `--cwd` to resolve the application files.

```js
const server = require('jamrock/server');

module.exports = server.init();
```

If you like, you can rename this file, just use `--app` to properly resolve from there.

## Page components

Write a **pages/index.html** file to start working on some stuff:

```html
<script>
  import { session, put_session } from 'jamrock/conn';

  export let value = session.name || 'world';

  $: name = value.toUpperCase();
  $: put_session('name', value);
</script>

<p>Hello, {name}.</p>
<input bind:value />
```

When you start the server as described below you'll be able to see this page rendered in your browser.

## Configuring your scripts

Declare some `scripts` in your **package.json** file to enable them as shortcuts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "jamrock server up",
    "watch": "jamrock server up -rw --no-redis --",
    "dist": "jamrock dist pages --"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "jamrock": "github:grownjs/jamrock#master"
  }
}
```

1. Using `npm run watch` will suffice to start working with the framework, the `-rw` flags enable the reload/watch modes respectively, `--no-redis` will disable Redis as needed. This is particulary useful for local development, or testing.

The `npm start` script will start the Jamrock server ready for production usage.

2. However, prior this you would like to compile the required assets for your application (if any), so `npm run dist` is used to accomplish the task. This is also true if you're running under CI or you're preparing the files for release.

The built-in bundler shall handle your styles and scripts, images or svg sprites. Even works for static pages, it ain't much, but it's honest work.

After math, you'll have two main **jamrock** tasks: `server` and `dist`.

## Bundler and watch-modes

Other tooling should enable watching both tasks, while you edit the server pages, the bundler will watch for changes too, you know.

For this, a `Makefile` will enable `make dev` to get both tasks running in parallel:

```make
dev:
  @npm run dist --watch & npm run watch
```

Alternatively, you can use **make** to enable a more powerful set of custom tasks:

```make
dev:
  @make -s watch

dist: deps
  @npm run dist $(DIST_FLAGS)

watch: deps
  @make -s dist DIST_FLAGS="--watch" & make -s watch-app

watch-app: deps
  @npm run watch

deps:
  @(((ls node_modules | grep .) > /dev/null 2>&1) || npm i) || true
```

This configuration is very extensible, as bonus, you might notice how the `deps` target will check and install packages if `node_modules` is empty or missing.

## Command Line

```bash
$ npm i -g jamrock # OR `yarn global add jamrock`
```

Run `jamrock` without arguments or with `--help` to display usage info.

> Alternatively, you can use **jam** or **rock** as aliases for **jamrock** ðŸ”¥.
